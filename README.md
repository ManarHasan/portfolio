# 👨‍💻 Manar Hasan – Backend Developer Portfolio

Hi, I’m Manar – a software engineer with 4+ years of professional experience across backend and fullstack roles. My background includes event-driven architectures, complex REST APIs, scheduling systems, and integrations with payment providers like Cybersource. Below are select examples of projects I’ve contributed to.

---

## 📆 Paleat – Food Delivery Platform Backend

**Stack:** NestJS · MongoDB · Swagger · Heroku · Firebase

A scalable food delivery backend powering vendors, drivers, and customers. Developed RESTful endpoints and role-based guards to support admin, manager, and user access. Worked on category handling, cart system, inventory, and order management.

### 🔐 Admin Dashboard API (NestJS)

- Guard-based route protection (AdminGuard, ManagerGuard, UserGuard)
- Integrated **Cybersource** for payment processing and refund flow
- Used MongoDB for flexible schema and document-based tracking

## 🏢 Gamiphy – Loyalty & CMS Backend

**Stack:** NestJS · MongoDB · RabbitMQ · Firebase

Contributed to a modular backend system supporting gamification mechanics, CMS features, and loyalty rewards. Supported multiple enterprise clients through tenant-aware services and asynchronous job flows.

- Used **RabbitMQ** for event/message propagation between services
- Firebase integration for real-time user data and auth sync

### 🕒 Job Scheduling System

> This custom NestJS scheduler uses `dayjs.tz` for timezone-aware triggers. It handles retries, in-progress states, failure recovery, and emits events that are expected to update their own `runAt` timestamps.

- Built out new backend endpoints and restructured models to support complete CRUD functionality
- Designed and implemented a new **admin dashboard** in React from scratch
- Integrated secure user access and added quality-of-life features for operational flow
- Migrated infrastructure to multi-stage AWS environments
